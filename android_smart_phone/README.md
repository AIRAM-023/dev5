This is the app that runs on an Android smart phone. It's by far the biggest thing, and does all the heavy lifting.

This app runs on its own, and other apps that use the SmartGlassesManager library talk to this app in the background.

## Install and build

Open, build, and run the app in `main/` from Android Studio, just like any other Android app.

## Architecture

See 'wiki' page for documentation.
